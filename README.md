🧠 Deep Learning Starter  

Welcome to Deep Learning Starter is  a collection of my first hands-on deep learning projects and experiments.  
This repo is my journey as I practice and grow my skills in deep learning using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.  



📂 Projects Included  

cifar_10.ipynb
  A CNN model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset (10 classes).  
  Focus: image classification basics.  

cifar_100.ipynb 
  Extends the idea to the CIFAR-100 dataset (100 classes).  
  Focus: working with more complex classification tasks.  

cnn_transfer_learning.ipynb  
  Using pre-trained CNN models (like VGG, ResNet, etc.) for transfer learning.  
  Focus: reusing knowledge from large models for smaller tasks.  

mnist_prac.ipynb 
  Simple digit recognition using the MNIST dataset.  
  Focus: building and training your first neural network.
